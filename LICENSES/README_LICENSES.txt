The ImageAnalysisTools project is developed under the MIT/X11 license (see source files or ImageAnalysisTools-license.txt for license text).  Several binary jar files of third party libraries necessary to run the project are included (unmodified from their developers' versions) in the project's lib subdirectory.  Their licenses are as follows:

loci_tools and omero_client are developed under the GNU General Public License (gpl-2.0.txt).

ImgLib2 is developed under the license found in ImgLib2-license.txt.

commons-math is developed as part of the Apache commons (http://commons.apache.org) under the Apache license (Apache-2.0.txt).

In accordance with those licenses that require it, you can obtain the sources from us (though we recommend getting them from their developers) as follows:

The sources for loci_tools are available from us at https://github.com/cjfuller/bioformats though the better way to obtain these is directly from the developers at http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/source-code.

The sources for omero_client are available from us at http://imageanalysistools.googlecode.com/files/omero-client-4.3.1-sources.tar.gz though the better way to obtain these is directly from the developers at http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/downloads.
