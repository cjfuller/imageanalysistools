The ImageAnalysisTools project is developed under the MIT/X11 license (see source files or ImageAnalysisTools-license.txt for license text).  Several binary jar files of third party libraries necessary to run the project are included (unmodified from their developers' versions) in the project's lib subdirectory.  Their licenses are as follows:

swing-layout is developed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (lgpl-2.1.txt).

bio-formats, loci-common, ome-xml, omero_client are developed under the GNU General Public License (gpl-2.0.txt).

commons-math and commons-logging are developed as part of the Apache commons (http://commons.apache.org) under the Apache license (Apache-2.0.txt).

In accordance with those licenses that require it, you can obtain the sources from us (though we recommend getting them from their developers) as follows:

The sources for bio-formats, loci-common, ome-xml are available at http://straightlab.stanford.edu/software in the archive loci-sources.tar.gz, though the better way to obtain these is directly from the developers at http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/source-code.

The sources for omero_client are available at http://straightlab.stanford.edu/software in the archive omero-sources.tar.gz, though the better way to obtain these is directly from the developers at http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/downloads.

The sources for swing-layout are available at http://straightlab.stanford.edu/software in the archive swing-layout-sources.tar.gz, though the better way to obtain these is directly from the developers at http://java.net/projects/swing-layout.
