{"body":"ImageAnalysisTools is a java library developed for processing and quantifying biological microscopy images. We use it particularly for the identification and quantification of centromeres and kinetochores, but the underlying infrastructure, which emphasizes rapid and easy development of new components, could be used for building tools to process any type of image.\r\n\r\nThe library consists of two package hierarchies: ...imageanalysistools, which contains all the library functionality, and ...analysistoolsinterface, which contains a GUI and runs as an ImageJ/FIJI plugin.\r\n\r\nFor more information on using the project from the GUI see Using ImageAnalysisTools.\r\n\r\nStarting with v4.0.0, it is possible to build new analysis methods at runtime without any additional programming by using the GUI. For documentation, see Creating analysis methods at runtime.\r\n\r\nFor more information on using the project as a library from your own code see Developing with ImageAnalysisTools.\r\n\r\nFull javadoc for the library is available in the git repository.
